\title{Data Description \\ \vspace{6pt} \large Environmental Administrative Penalties and Firms' Green Technological Innovation}
\author{Yifan Mao}

\maketitle

This study examines the effect of environmental administrative penalties on Chinese listed firms' green technological innovation. Our final sample includes A-share listed firms over 2015--2020. The environmental administrative penalty records are compiled by Qingyue Data based on penalty decisions published on government environmental authority websites. Firm financial data come from WIND and CSMAR. Patent application records are obtained from the China National Intellectual Property Administration (SIPO). Green patents are identified following the WIPO ``green patent'' IPC classification.

The main sample construction and cleaning steps are: Exclude firms labeled ``ST'' during the sample period; Drop observations missing required variables used in the analysis; Exclude firms in the financial industry; Sum all penalty amounts for the same firm in the same year to obtain a firm-year total penalty amount.

After matching and cleaning, the working sample contains 5,023 firm-year observations from 914 distinct listed firms (2015--2020). Among them, 1,456 firm-year observations have positive total penalty amounts. Table~\ref{tab:variables} lists the main variables used in the empirical analysis, their English dataset names and corresponding definitions.

Table~\ref{tab:desc} reports descriptive statistics for the main variables used in the empirical analysis. The sample for these statistics is the final cleaned sample (5,023 firm-year observations, 2015--2020). The reported statistics are mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.
